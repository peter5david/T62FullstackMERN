# T62FullstackMERN

## System Architecture:

##### This is a readme file for my final project at Hyperion Dev

The task is to create a Full stack MERN application

I built up the webpage with the following technologies:
- **React:** used for the frontend to display for the users
    - *react-router-dom:* module has been used for the navigations between the pages
- **Express, Node.js:** used for the backend programming
  - *nodemon:* used at the backend to update the webpage all the times when changes has made
  - *jsonwebtoken:* used at the backend for the login (JWT authentication)
  - *mongoose, morgan, cors, dotenv:* used for the database
- **MongoDB:** used for the database to store the datas(more collections, for more details)
    - one collections table for the users
    - one collections table for the holidays requests
    - one collections for the complaints
    - one collections for the news
- **HTML, CSS:** used for the desing of the frontend, to get a well presented User Interface (UI)

### This app will deploy with the npm start 
```sh
npm start
```
- The website will be available under **git hub** and on under **my domain** too.
